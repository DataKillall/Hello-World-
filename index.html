    <h1>Hello World! (Introduction to Frontend Development)</h1>

    <p>Before the digital era:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: green;">a memory was something you'd possibly forget with time</li>
        <li style="color: green;">an app served for employment</li>
        <li style="color: green;">a program was broadcasted on TV</li>
        <li style="color: red;">a cursor used profanity</li>
        <li style="color: green;">a keyboard was a part of a piano</li>
        <li style="color: green;">web housed spiders</li>
        <li style="color: red;">virus was the flu</li>
        <li style="color: green;">CD was a bank account</li>
        <li style="color: green;">a hard drive was a long road trip</li>
        <li style="color: red;">and if someone had a 3 1/2 inch floppy.. they just hoped nobody would ever find out..</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The 90’s as we all know made the World Wide Web available to the masses, we threw our pagers in drawers full of dead Tamagotchis and happily sang along the dial-up tune (read: noise) that led to the place to be.</p>

    <p style="color: blue;">“Did you hear about the computer that kept rebooting? It was terminal.“</p>

    <p>The reach of analog goes digital was quite extensive yet still only just scratching the surface of what could have come from it.</p>

    <p>Today we navigate the world with digital eyes and our definition of reality is completely warped. Cache of virtual weapons? Self-note: Stop being oblivious to own security practices, the struggle is real.</p>

    <p style="color: red;">“How did the farmer sell his veggies on the dark web? - Onion routing."</p>

    <p>So, I missed out on a couple of decades but here I am making up for it.</p>

    <p>I hope I’ll fit in and won’t “overddos”. </p>
